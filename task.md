# Alte und Neue Studienleistungen: Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Dataset Description

* Publicly available data set
* Scans of hand-written digits, with correct labels
* E.g., second row represents the digit 2
* Each image is 28x28 pixels of grey scale values

## Exercise

**Task:** Predict the written number based on the pixel values

* Train a naive bayes and a decision tree model to classify handwritten digits
* Use any programming language you like

### Data format

* CSV files train.csv and test.csv
* Each row has 1+28*28 cells
* Cell 1: The correct label
* Cells 2-785: The pixel gray scale values from 0 to 255

### Submission

* Upload the evaluation table (precision, recall, F1 score) to Ilias until December 11th
